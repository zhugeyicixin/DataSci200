The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored. We will walk through various steps of exploratory data analysis to do this. We will provide comments and insights along the way to give you a sense of how we arrive at each discovery and what next steps it leads to.\n",

Since this class isn't really about the nuances of the Python file system libraries, we've provided a function for you in ds100_utils.py called `fetch_and_cache` that can download files from the internet.\n",

The weaknesses is that the sampling might be biased due to the inequal size of each cluster. Some regions may have a lot of restaurants, while some may only have several ones. Therefore, a restaurant in those regions with less retaurants get larger probability to be collected in the sample than a restaurant in the regions with mnay restaurants. And by picking only one restaurant from each region, that restaurant may not be enough to represent the whole region.\n",

    "Create a new dataframe of counts of the null and proportion of null values, storing the result in `fraction_missing_df`. It should have an index called `postal_code_5` and should also have 3 columns:\n",

    "1. `count null`: The number of missing values for the zip code.\n",

The waitress came over and yelled at us and demand more $$, we told them the food are not fresh, she said this food suppose to be this! Are you fxxking kidding me?!

    "First, make a dataframe called `scores_pairs_by_business` indexed by `business_id` (containing only businesses with exactly 2 inspections in 2016).  This dataframe contains the field `score_pair` consisting of the score pairs ordered chronologically  `[first_score, second_score]`. \n",

    "2. In the histogram, if a restaurant's score improves, the data point should be \"in\" a bar corresponding to posive value of score difference. Morere scores improve, more bars and higher bars in the right side of 0. However, what I actaully see is that the distribution of the bars in the left side of 0 and in the right side of 0 are similar, which means only half of the score improves and the rest half got even worse."
